# Geant4 simulation of the UTR at HIγS

This is a [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/) simulation of the Upstream Target Room (UTR) at the High Intensity γ-ray Source (HIγS) facility, located at the Duke Free Electron Laser Laboratory (DFELL) of the Triangle University Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) at Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.
